# Letterpress Player

Solves Letterpress games via OCR and colour categorization. Work in progress.

Disclaimer: This code is *nasty ugly*, but functional.

# Usage

Take a screenshot of a Letterpress game then launch this app immediately. Wait a few seconds and you'll see all possible words, ordered by score.

# Goals

Right now, this is more of a "cheating" app, but the end goal is to have a fully automated Letterpress player. Items in the To Do List will address thatâ€¦ eventually.

# To Do List

1. Improve performance. Analysis takes ~7s on my iPhone 5.
2. Refactor: this code was written in a few hours and its sense of style is frightening.
3. Improve UI. Currently awful.
4. Improve scoring algorithm to account for making tiles deep blue and finishing a game when a winning word is possible.
5. Keep a list of played words.
6. Build a physical iOS testing machine to automate playing.
